This is a placeholder for a favicon file.

To add a proper favicon:
1. Create a favicon.ico file
2. Place it in the src/main/resources/static directory
3. It will be automatically served at the context root

Alternatively, you can use an emoji favicon as was previously done, but with proper JSF resource handling.
